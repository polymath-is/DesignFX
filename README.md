# Graphic Design App

A graphic design app, with decentralized storage, and pre-built templates. 

This allows you to add text, shapes, and imagery to your designs, or convert your images to designs. 

Images will be generated using the gdl WebAssembly library, which allows for faster conversion of the canvas to an image.
